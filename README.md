Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. These elements are:

- the model, the internal representations of information
- the view, the interface that presents information to and accepts it from the user
- the controller, the software linking the two.

Traditionally used for desktoip graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern became popular for designing web applications. Popular programming languages have MVC frameworks that facilitate the implementation of the pattern.
